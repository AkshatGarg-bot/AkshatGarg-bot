### Hi there ğŸ‘‹


**AkshatGarg-bot/AkshatGarg-bot** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on video streaming app
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning video compression algorithms
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking to contribute for open sources.
- ğŸ’¼ Implemented a research paper related to [residual cache](https://github.com/AkshatGarg-bot/ResidueCache).
- ğŸ’¼ Currently working as a intern in [Turnera Tech](https://turneratech.com/).
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am not a bot.
